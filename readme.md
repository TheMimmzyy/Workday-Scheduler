*Welcome to my fifth homework project!*

Index.html:
I began with this page and started with bootstrap, I linked the library and decided on appropriate elements to use. This allowed me to setup the page layout, getting the title and header oriented where I liked and adding the clock just below. Then the time blocks (the real trick here was connecting these to local storage) which was simple sizing and repeated coded lines with slight differences to note each hour. This page was fairly simple to setup due to the ease off acces that bootstrap allows.

Script.js:
I then moved to the functionality within the js file, this was a fairly simple step from the last homework assignment. I began this by creating an object, containing each hour within it, that I could call in later functions. I then designed a function that would update the calendar tasks as the page is loaded or reloaded. Then I moved to making the functions that would connect the text areas to my local storage. A quick task was the code needed to add the functional clock beneath the header. After that was looping the added text into the object I created earlier and coonect it the save buttons, during this I created a function using a switch statement to be used as a variable in the for loop. Then was designing the functions for the save button to save the added text into local storage.

Style.css:
My style sheet I did while I was constructing the fucntionality of the app, it was very basic. Just coloring, text size and some margin adjustments to orient the page more precisely.
